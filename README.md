# Workflow

Workflow is an event driven workflow that allows for robust, durable, and scalable sequential business logic to
be executed in a deterministic manner.

---
## Features

- **Tech stack agnostic:** Use Kafka, Cassandra, Redis, MongoDB, Postgresql, MySQL, RabbitM, or Reflex - the choice is yours!
- **Graph based (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):** Design the workflow by defining small units of work called "Steps".
- **TDD:** Workflow was built using TDD and remains well-supported through a suit of tools.
- **Schedule:** Allows standard cron spec to schedule workflows 
- **Timeouts:** Set either a dynamic or static time for a workflow to wait for. Once the timeout finishes everything continues as it was.
- **Event fusion:** Add event connectors to your workflow to consume external event streams (even if its from a different event streaming platform).  
- **Callbacks:** Allow for manual callbacks from webhooks or manual triggers from consoles to progress the workflow such as approval buttons or third-party webhooks.  
- **Parallel consumers:** Specify how many step consumers should run or specify the default for all consumers. 
- **Consumer management:** Consumer management and graceful shutdown of all processes making sure there is no goroutine leaks!

---

## Installation
To start using workflow you will need to add the workflow module to your project. You can do this by running:
```bash
go get github.com/luno/workflow
```

### Adapters
Some adapters dont come with the core workflow module such as `kafkastreamer`, `reflexstreamer`, `sqlstore`, and `sqltimeout`. If you
 wish to use these you need to add them individually based on your needs or build out your own adapter.

#### Kafka
```bash
go get github.com/luno/workflow/adapters/kafkastreamer
```

#### Reflex
```bash
go get github.com/luno/workflow/adapters/reflexstreamer
```

#### SQL Store
```bash
go get github.com/luno/workflow/adapters/sqlstore
```

#### SQL Timeout
```bash
go get github.com/luno/workflow/adapters/sqltimeout
```
---
## Usage

### Step 1: Define the workflow
```go
package usage

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/luno/workflow"
)

type Step int

func (s Step) String() string {
	switch s {
	case StepOne:
		return "One"
	case StepTwo:
		return "Two"
	case StepThree:
		return "Three"
	default:
		return "Unknown"
	}
}

const (
	StepUnknown Step = 0
	StepOne Step = 1
	StepTwo Step = 2
	StepThree Step = 3
)

type MyType struct {
	Field string
}

func Workflow() *workflow.Workflow[MyType, Step] {
	b := workflow.NewBuilder[MyType, Step]("my workflow name")

	b.AddStep(StepOne, func(ctx context.Context, r *workflow.Run[MyType, Step]) (Step, error) {
		r.Object.Field = "Hello,"
		return StepTwo, nil
	}, StepTwo)

	b.AddStep(StepTwo, func(ctx context.Context, r *workflow.Run[MyType, Step]) (Step, error) {
		r.Object.Field += " world!"
		return StepThree, nil
	}, StepThree)

	return b.Build(...)
}
```

stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
    
	[*]-->One
    One-->Two
    Two-->Three
    Three-->[*]
```
### Step 2: Run the workflow
```go
wf := usage.Workflow()

ctx := context.Background()
wf.Run(ctx)
```
**Stop:** To stop all processes and wait for them to shut down correctly call
```go
wf.Stop()
```
### Step 3: Trigger the workflow
```go
foreignID := "82347982374982374"
runID, err := wf.Trigger(ctx, foreignID, StepOne)
if err != nil {
	...
}
```
**Awaiting results:** If appropriate and desired you can wait for the workflow to complete. Using context timeout (cancellation) is advised.
```go
foreignID := "82347982374982374"
runID, err := wf.Trigger(ctx, foreignID, StepOne)
if err != nil {
	...
}

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 10 * time.Second)
defer cancel()

record, err := wf.Await(ctx, foreignID, runID, StepThree)
if err != nil {
	...
}
```

## Workflow's RunState
RunState is the state of a workflow run and can only exist in one state at any given time. RunState is a
 finite state machine and allows for control over the workflow run. A workflow run is every instance of
 a triggered workflow.

    state Finished {
        Completed --> RequestedDataDeleted
        Cancelled --> RequestedDataDeleted
            
        DataDeleted-->RequestedDataDeleted
        RequestedDataDeleted-->DataDeleted
    }
```

## Configuration Options

This package provides several options to configure the behavior of the workflow process. You can use these options to customize the instance count, polling frequency, error handling, lag settings, and more. Each option is defined as a function that takes a pointer to an `options` struct and modifies it accordingly. Below is a description of each available option:

### `ParallelCount`

```go
func ParallelCount(instances int) Option
```

- **Description:** Defines the number of instances of the workflow process. These instances are distributed consistently, each named to reflect its position (e.g., "consumer-1-of-5"). This helps in managing parallelism in workflow execution.
- **Parameters:**
    - `instances`: The total number of parallel instances to create.
- **Usage Example:**
```go
b.AddStep(
    StepOne,
    ...,
    StepTwo,
).WithOptions(
    workflow.ParallelCount(5)
)
```

### `PollingFrequency`

```go
func PollingFrequency(d time.Duration) Option
```

- **Description:** Sets the duration at which the workflow process polls for changes. Adjust this to control how frequently the process checks for new events or updates.
- **Parameters:**
    - `d`: The polling frequency as a `time.Duration`.
- **Usage Example:**
```go
b.AddStep(
    StepOne,
    ...,
    StepTwo,
).WithOptions(
    workflow.PollingFrequency(10 * time.Second)
)
```

### `ErrBackOff`

```go
func ErrBackOff(d time.Duration) Option
```

- **Description:** Defines the duration for which the workflow process will back off after encountering an error. This is useful for managing retries and avoiding rapid repeated failures.
- **Parameters:**
    - `d`: The backoff duration as a `time.Duration`.
- **Usage Example:**
```go
b.AddStep(
    StepOne,
    ...,
    StepTwo,
).WithOptions(
    workflow.ErrBackOff(5 * time.Minute)
)
```
### `LagAlert`

```go
func LagAlert(d time.Duration) Option
```

- **Description:** Specifies the time threshold before a Prometheus metric switches to true, indicating that the workflow consumer is struggling to keep up. This can signal the need to convert to a parallel consumer.
- **Parameters:**
    - `d`: The duration of the lag alert as a `time.Duration`.
- **Usage Example:**
```go
b.AddStep(
    StepOne,
    ...,
    StepTwo,
).WithOptions(
    workflow.LagAlert(15 * time.Minute),
)
```
### `ConsumeLag`

```go
func ConsumeLag(d time.Duration) Option
```

- **Description:** Defines the maximum age of events that the consumer will process. Events newer than the specified duration will be held until they are older than the lag period.
- **Parameters:**
    - `d`: The lag duration as a `time.Duration`.
- **Usage Example:**
```go
b.AddStep(
    StepOne,
    ...,
    StepTwo,
).WithOptions(
    workflow.ConsumeLag(10 * time.Minute),
)
```
### `PauseAfterErrCount`

```go
func PauseAfterErrCount(count int) Option
```

- **Description:** Sets the number of errors allowed before a record is updated to `RunStatePaused`. This mechanism acts similarly to a Dead Letter Queue, preventing further processing of problematic records and allowing for investigation and retry.
- **Parameters:**
    - `count`: The maximum number of errors before pausing.
- **Usage Example:**
```go
b.AddStep(
    StepOne,
    ...,
    StepTwo,
).WithOptions(
    workflow.PauseAfterErrCount(3),
)
```
